Credit goes out to the original author of the website, alphamouse, who I edited the original calculator from which can be found at http://alphamou.se/ti4calc/. 
I didn't really want to do a fork as I have never used github before and my code is a little garbage if you know what I mean.

I added leaders, a whole bunch of action cards, added some agendas and the nebulae which I thought was weirdly missing from the original.
The new factions should work correctly, however I could not figure out how to incorporate argent flights Raid Formation without doing the imitator calculation.

Some interesting notes:
You can specify whether L1Z1X mechs are participating in the combat or not, same with xxcha flagship
Nomad mechs can use their sustain damage during space combat but are not affected by duranium
There are settings at the bottom to indicate whether the opponent has a relic fragment or you copied their faction tech for naalu and nekro mechs respectively.
Some other cool stuff you can figure out while using it.
